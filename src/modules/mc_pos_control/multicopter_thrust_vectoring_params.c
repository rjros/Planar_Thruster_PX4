/**
 * Thrust vectoring attitude mode
 *
 * Specifies the type of attitude setpoint sent to the attitude controller.
 * The parameter can be set to a normal attitude setpoint, where the tilt
 * of the vehicle (roll and pitch) are calculated from the desired thrust
 * vector. This should be the behavior for the non-omnidirectional vehicles,
 * such as quadrotors and other multirotors with coplanar rotors.
 * The "constant zero tilt" mode enforces zero roll and pitch and can only be
 * used for omnidirectional vehicles. The min-tilt mode enforces zero tilt
 * up to a maximum set acceleration (thrust) and tilts the vehicle as small
 * as possible if the thrust vector is larger than the maximum. The "constant
 * tilt" and "constant roll/pitch" modes enforce a given tilt or roll/pitch
 * for the vehicle. The estimation modes estimate the optimal tilt or roll/pitch
 * to counteract with the external force (e.g., wind).
 *
